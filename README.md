# Genetic_Algorithm_TSP
A bespoke python genetic algorithm to solve the generalised 2D travelling salesman problem. 
The code is mostly modular to allow for comparisons of GA parameters. 
Future additions will see implementation of additional selection and crossover processes.

HOW TO:
1. Download and unzip files. 
2. Open TSP_run.py and modify the user inputs to suit your needs.
3. Run TSP_run.py
4. Review outputs.

User inputs:
1. total_number_towns
2. total_GA_population_size
3. town_location_limit_lowerX
4. town_location_limit_upperX
5. town_location_limit_lowerY
6. town_location_limit_upperY
7. elitism_rate
